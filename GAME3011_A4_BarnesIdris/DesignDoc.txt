I got the inspiration for the hacking mini game from the hacking feature in splinter cell double agent. 
I believe the idea behind it is there is a “signal” (just a sine wave) that you are trying to hack. 
And you do this by replicating the target “signal” with our own. 



The system has 5 inputs that change 2 values. 
A and D will adjust the signals frequency. 
W and S will adjust the signals amplitude. Once you feel like your hacking signal is a good enough match press H to hack. 
(After designing this system it became apparent it was originally intended for controller input only) 



There are three levels of difficulty in the system:



Easy - slow moving signal with generous allowance (allowance just meaning your signal doesn’t have to match 100%)



Medium - medium moving signal with moderate allowance



Hard - fast moving signal that occasionally changes directions with low allowance 



The player gains “skill” after every successful hack. As the player skill increases, 
the sensitivity of the inputs for adjusting the waves become lowered - thus making it easier to get a more precise match.
